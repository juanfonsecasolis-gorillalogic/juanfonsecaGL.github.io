## Abstract
**Problem.** 

Our previous experience in software development has led us to find better ways to write automation, particularly, we want to know if we can improve the execution time of the daily regressions, decrease the maintenance costs of automation, facilitate the interaction with ReactJS pages, make easier for manual testers write automation too, and incorporate Artificial Intelligence tools.

**Motivation.** We have observed that these areas of improvement are ubiquitous across teams and could be of interest to the community. 

**Objectives.** This review paper aims to understand the cause of the problems described and find better test and development practices. 

**Methodology.** The approach consisted of a literature review of publications made by test automation coaches. 

**Conclusions.** To be defined...

## 1. Introduction
Working in test automation is a joy for many test members. Besides allowing them to apply their knowledge of computer programming, it facilitates the release of code to production and alleviates the burden of manual testers, as in Agile working environments test cases get cumulative over time. Without automation, the development teams won't be able to implement practices like Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and DevOps.

So far, the technology stack used by the team to perform automation has been C#, Selenium WebDriver, nUnit, and Specflow/LivingDoc for Behavioral Driven Development (BDD). Although this stack has let us offer solutions, we have noticed some improvement areas, such as shortening the execution times of daily automated regressions, decreasing maintenance costs, and interacting more easily with ReactJS pages. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature to find solutions to the mentioned areas.

In section 2 we perform a literature review and provide some insights about Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to automation, in section 3 we contrast the solutions found with our current technology stack, and in section 4 we present our conclusions and recommendations.
